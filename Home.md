# Manual de Uso Rundeck - Sonda.

La siguiente guía presenta la información básica para poder administrar la plataforma Rundeck en Sonda.

[1.- INSTALACIÓN Y CONFIGURACIÓN](https://bitbucket.org/uaicloudlab/rundeck/wiki/1.-%20Instalaci%C3%B3n%20y%20Configuraci%C3%B3n)

The wiki itself is actually a git repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to us. It will be live immediately.

Go ahead and try:

```
$ git clone https://cabrerabywaters@bitbucket.org/cabrerabywaters/rundeck.git/wiki
```

Wiki pages are normal files, with the .md extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.

## Syntax highlighting


You can also highlight snippets of text (we use the excellent [Pygments][] library).

[Pygments]: http://pygments.org/


Here's an example of some Python code:

```
#!python

def wiki_rocks(text):
    formatter = lambda t: "funky"+t
    return formatter(text)
```


You can check out the source of this page to see how that's done, and make sure to bookmark [the vast library of Pygment lexers][lexers], we accept the 'short name' or the 'mimetype' of anything in there.

Have fun!
